# internship-project-2025
Predictive modeling using energy consumption data from a Norwegian port city
## Objective
The main goal of this internship project is to collect and analyze energy consumption and meteorological data for the city. Using these datasets, the project aims to explore and implement time series forecasting models to accurately predict future energy demand. This approach will help in understanding the patterns and relationships between weather conditions and energy usage, ultimately supporting better energy management and planning.
